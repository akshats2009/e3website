            <p>A blur of red and gold danced throughout the streets of Chinese Lunar New Year. The Chinese Dragon moves as one body, yet are held by a collective—symbolism of the values the community lives by. Red lanterns glow outside houses, while mahjong tiles clatter by the elders table and scents of a New Year Feast flow out of the kitchen. To most people, Chinatown is a place with cheap food, milk tea cafes, and souvenir shops. However, Chinatown is more than just a community of family businesses; it's an ethnic economy built upon history, cultural preservation, legacy, and kinship. It’s living proof of an alternative model of economic life, one sustained by belonging and identity rather than profit and individualism.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The first notable wave of Chinese immigrants came in the late 1840s during the California Gold Rush, with the population rising from approximately 7,500 in 1850 to more than 100,000 in 1880 (MCC). While many migrated to the U.S in search of gold, the majority of Chinese immigrants found work in another rising industry, the Transcontinental Railroad. In fact, many estimates suggest that 80% of the grueling construction was done by Chinese workers (MCC).</p>
            <p>Yet, despite a history of hard work, Chinese immigrants were faced with discrimination. Deniz Kearney’s Working Party rallied support for the destruction of Chinese businesses with slogans “The Chinese Must Go”, crystalizing the term “Yellow Peril” (PBS). Race riots like the 1871 Los Angeles riot saw twenty Chinese immigrants dead. The racial tension culminated in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, prohibiting Chinese immigration. The act would not be repealed until 1943 with the Magnuson act, allowing only 105 immigrants per year.</p>
            <p>In an attempt to achieve solidarity in the face of everyday racism, Chinese immigrants built Chinatown, which became the most important factor for economic survival. The first sizable Chinatown was in San Francisco. In 1880, the town had 22,000 immigrants, filled with family run businesses like restaurants, recreation centers, herbal stores, market places, and even a Chinese theater (PBS). The economic diversity of family businesses allowed a self-sufficient environment. Specifically, the circulating economy allowed resources to stay in the community, avoiding reliance on the greater San Francisco. </p>
            <p>Similar to how San Francisco's Chinatown created economic solidarity, New York City’s Chinatown was another epitome of Chinese culture. In 1890, the streets of NYC Chinatown were full of cultural restaurants, Joss Houses, and even a Chinese language theater (NPS). Chinese architecture flourished through the modification of existing buildings. Mainly, second story porches, pagoda-style porch roofs, bold plaques, and Chinese ornaments became popular additions to the dull houses of NYC. Markets and herbal stores soon became hubs of traditional Chinese food, drinks, and medicine, reducing the need to fill cultural gaps with Western culture.</p>
            <p><em>Author Note: Joss houses are taoist shrines</em></p>

            <h2>Modern</h2>
            <p>Chinatown isn’t complacent, constantly evolving to fit the needs of each generation. For example, the youth cultural workers of San Francisco's Chinatown have created new events like monthly night markets, cultural festivals that mix modern and traditional heritage themes, and curated stores to showcase art (Wu). New organizations like Chinatown’s Media & Arts Collaborative have opened galleries, and Florence Fang notably founded two museums on Chinese American history. </p>
            <p>However, the story of new innovation isn’t tied to San Francisco. All around America, Chinatown’s are rapidly changing for the new generation. Seattle’s Chinatown has modern eateries of BBQ pork chops and hand-pulled noodles, while Philadelphia’s new cafes and murals as well as ancient traditions of parades and the Mid-Autumn Festival blend heritage and change (Siegelmann). Yet, the biggest change is the influx of new cultures, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, and Vietnamese into Chinatown, mixing Chinese culture into the modern Asian melting pot.</p>
            <p>Amidst the changes Chinatown undergoes, structural elements remain intact to continue Chinatown’s legacy as a community built upon solidarity. Chinatowns today are filled with family businesses, such as restaurants, recreation centers, marketplaces, and retail stores that allow the community to remain self-sufficient. In the place of closed down family businesses pop up new ones like boba cafes, souvenir shops, and restaurants with a blend of Asian foods. The economy remains circulating but expanding as tourism grows. Chinese citizens and immigrants continue to remain cohesive, harnessing collective strength against modern challenges of gentrification rather than racism. For example, Philadelphia’s Chinatown Development Corporation (PCDC) embodies the symbol of collective strength as it continues to rally support to fight against new urban projects that intrude on Chinatown (Barber).</p>
            <p>In a similar fashion, Chinatown remains a significant anchor in cultural preservation. Streets are filled with parades, lit up by red lanterns, and enriched with the aroma of traditional foods during holidays like Lunar New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival. Religious temples and cultural theaters maintain popularity as new parks are constructed. The architectural aesthetic remains the same; pagados have transformed into archways as bold plaques and Chinese ornaments continue to be a must (Maganga). The only difference–Chinatown combines traditions with modern cultural shifts. Bold plaques are combined with neon signs, cultural theaters have movie theaters beside them, and traditional restaurants now include a touch of American culture.</p>
            <p>150 years later, the same blur of red and yellow dances through the streets of Chinese Lunar New Year. The same red lanterns glow outside houses, while mahjong tiles clatter in crowded rooms beneath the hums of kitchens preparing holiday feasts. Beneath the boba cafes and delicious restaurants tourists see lies a legacy of determination. Initially built out of necessity to combat discrimination, Chinatown has evolved beyond a community built for economic solidarity and cultural preservation. It has become a place where the old and new generation intertwine but values (belonging, identity, and community) remain constant. Chinatown’s legacy isn’t static. It grows and adapts under the same powerful values standing a century and a half later.</p>
