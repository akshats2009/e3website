            <p>A blur of red and gold danced throughout the streets of Chinese Lunar New Year. The Chinese Dragon moves as one body, yet are held by a collective—symbolism of the values the community holds as a whole. </p>
            
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The first notable wave of Chinese immigrants came in the late 1840s during the California Gold Rush, with the population rising from approximately 7,500 in 1850 to more than 100,000 by 1880. These immigrants sought better lives, however, found themselves limited by institutional barriers. For example, during the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, Chinese immigrants did the most dangerous work, yet were paid 30 to 50 percent less than their white counterparts. </p>
            <p>Yet, despite a history of hard work, Chinese immigrants were faced with discrimination. Deniz Kearney’s Working Party rallied support for the destruction of Chinese businesses with the slogan “The Chinese Must Go.” These actions eventually led to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned all Chinese laborers from entering the United States for 10 years, and was later extended in 1892. This was the first time in history that a single ethnic group was excluded from immigration. </p>
            <p>In an attempt to achieve solidarity in the face of everyday racism, Chinese immigrants built Chinatown, which became the most important factor for economic survival. The first sizable community was San Francisco’s Chinatown, which served as a buffer from the hostile outside world. Within Chinatown, immigrants built their own networks of support, such as the Six Companies (the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association). These organizations helped immigrants find jobs, settle legal disputes, and send money back to their families. </p>
            <p>Similar to how San Francisco's Chinatown created economic solidarity, New York City’s Chinatown was another epitome of Chinese culture. In 1890, the streets of NYC Chinatown were filled with joss houses, gambling houses, and grocery stores. These businesses were not just for economic gain, but were symbols of resilience. Small businesses such as laundries and restaurants became staples, which offered a pathway to economic independence. By creating their own self-sustaining economic ecosystem, Chinese immigrants transformed discrimination into community solidarity. </p>
            <p><em>Author Note: Joss houses are taoist shrines</em></p>

            <h2>Modern</h2>
            <p>Chinatown isn’t complacent, constantly evolving to fit the needs of each generation. For example, the youth cultural workers of San Francisco's Chinatown have created new events like the Chinatown Music Festival, which combines traditional music with contemporary genres. This shift ensures Chinatown remains relevant for the younger generation, while still keeping traditional values. </p>
            <p>However, the story of new innovation isn’t tied to San Francisco. All around America, Chinatown’s are rapidly changing for the new generation. Seattle’s Chinatown has modern evening markets, where youth entrepreneurs can sell their products and connect with the community. These events aren't just for profit, but for building a community. By engaging the youth, Chinatown is ensuring its survival for the next 150 years. </p>
            <p>Amidst the changes Chinatown undergoes, structural elements remain intact to continue Chinatown’s legacy as a community built upon solidarity. Chinatowns today are filled with family-run restaurants, traditional pharmacies, and cultural centers. These businesses are more than just shops—they are community anchors. They provide a space for elders to gather, for families to celebrate, and for youth to learn about their heritage. </p>
            <p>In a similar fashion, Chinatown remains a significant anchor in cultural preservation. Streets are filled with parades, lit up by red lanterns, and enriched with the aroma of traditional foods. These cultural elements are symbols of the resilience of Chinese immigrants. By preserving their culture, Chinese immigrants are ensuring that their legacy lives on. </p>
            <p>150 years later, the same blur of red and yellow dances through the streets of Chinese Lunar New Year. The same red lanterns glow outside houses, while mahjong tiles clatter in crowded tea houses. Chinatown is more than just a place to live—it is a symbol of economic solidarity and community resilience. Through 150 years of change, Chinatown remains a home for those who seek to build a better life. </p>
